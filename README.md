## Process 
<br>
<br>
1.Data Collection: Gathering flight data from Goibibo's database or data warehouse. This data includes flight details like origin and destination, airline, class, number of stops, price, and duration.
<br>
2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. This step ensures data quality and reliability.
<br>
3.KPI Definition and Calculation: Defining the key performance indicators (KPIs) to be tracked and calculated. Examples include total flights, revenue, average price, and flight duration.
<br>
4.Data Modeling and Structuring: Organizing the data in a way that facilitates analysis and visualization. This may involve creating relationships between different data tables.
<br>
5.Dashboard Design and Development: Designing the layout and user interface of the dashboard. This includes selecting appropriate charts, graphs, and tables to visualize the data effectively. Power BI is used for this purpose. The progression of the four images shows iterative design improvements, such as adding more interactive elements and refining the layout.
<br>
6.Interactive Features Implementation: Adding interactive elements like filters, slicers, and drill-downs to allow users to explore the data dynamically. The later images show more sophisticated filtering options.
<br>
7.Testing and Refinement: Testing the dashboard thoroughly to ensure accuracy and usability. Based on user feedback, refinements are made to the design and functionality.
<br>
8.Deployment and Sharing: Deploying the dashboard to a server or cloud platform and sharing it with relevant stakeholders.
