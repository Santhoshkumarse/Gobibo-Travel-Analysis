# Goibibo Travel Analysis: Insights and Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using PowerBI)
## Project Objective
• Monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Track metrics like total flights, flights by airline, total revenue, average ticket price, and total flight duration.
<br>
• Analyze Flight Data: Explore flight data by various dimensions such as airline, class, number of stops, and origin/destination cities.
<br>
• Identify Trends and Patterns: Uncover trends in flight demand, pricing, and airline performance over time.
<br>
• Support Decision-Making: Provide data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions related to pricing optimization, route planning, resource allocation, and marketing campaigns.

## Dataset used
-<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g8A0idR-W1TcD4JW3ZLKfq1mwZryOSZB/view?usp=drive_link">Dataset</a>

## Questions for KPI
1. Overall Performance & Scale:
•Total Flights: How many flights has Goibibo facilitated/analyzed in this dataset?
<br>
•Flights by Airline: What is the distribution of flights across different airlines?
<br>
•Total Revenue: What is the total revenue generated from these flights?
<br>
•Average Ticket Price: What is the average price of a ticket?
<br>
•Sum of Total Duration: What is the total combined duration of all flights?
<br>
<br>
2. Airline-Specific Performance:
<br>
•Average Price by Airline: How do average ticket prices vary across different airlines?
<br>
•Revenue by Airline: What is the revenue generated by each airline?
<br>
•Flight Volume by Airline: How many flights does each airline operate? 
<br>
<br>
3. Impact of Flight Characteristics:
<br>
•Average Price by Stop Category: How does the number of stops (layovers) affect the average ticket price?
<br>
•Sum of Price and %GT Sum of Total_Duration by Class: How do price and total flight duration vary by class (Business, Economy)?
<br>
<br>
4. Route-Specific Analysis:
<br>
•Sum of Price by From and To: What is the price distribution for flights between different origin and destination cities?
<br>

## Process 
<br>
1.Data Collection: Gathering flight data from Goibibo's database or data warehouse. This data includes flight details like origin and destination, airline, class, number of stops, price, and duration.
<br>
2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. This step ensures data quality and reliability.
<br>
3.KPI Definition and Calculation: Defining the key performance indicators (KPIs) to be tracked and calculated. Examples include total flights, revenue, average price, and flight duration.
<br>
4.Data Modeling and Structuring: Organizing the data in a way that facilitates analysis and visualization. This may involve creating relationships between different data tables.
<br>
5.Dashboard Design and Development: Designing the layout and user interface of the dashboard. This includes selecting appropriate charts, graphs, and tables to visualize the data effectively. Power BI is used for this purpose. The progression of the four images shows iterative design improvements, such as adding more interactive elements and refining the layout.
<br>
6.Interactive Features Implementation: Adding interactive elements like filters, slicers, and drill-downs to allow users to explore the data dynamically. The later images show more sophisticated filtering options.
<br>
7.Testing and Refinement: Testing the dashboard thoroughly to ensure accuracy and usability. Based on user feedback, refinements are made to the design and functionality.
<br>
8.Deployment and Sharing: Deploying the dashboard to a server or cloud platform and sharing it with relevant stakeholders.
<br>

## Conslusion
<br>
Goibibo's flight data reveals several key trends.  While Economy class dominates in volume, generating **5 billion in revenue**, Business class contributes a substantial 1 billion despite a much smaller volume.  **Vistara leads airlines in average price at 31,000**, significantly higher than competitors like Air India (24,000), SpiceJet (6,000), Go First (6,000), IndiGo (5,000), Star Air (5,000), AirAsia (4,000), and Trujet (3,000).  This suggests a premium pricing strategy for Vistara.  Interestingly, **flights with two stops have a higher average price (14,281.73) than those with one or zero stops**, which warrants further investigation.  Analyzing route-specific data, Mumbai to Kolkata emerges as a high-value route, generating 300 million, followed by Mumbai to Hyderabad at 281 million and Mumbai to Delhi at 302 million.  These insights highlight areas for strategic focus, including optimizing pricing for multi-stop flights and capitalizing on high-revenue routes.  Further analysis is recommended to understand the factors driving these trends and identify opportunities for growth.
